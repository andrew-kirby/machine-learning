@Article{ga_tutorial,
	author="Whitley, Darrell",
	title="A genetic algorithm tutorial",
	journal="Statistics and Computing",
	year="1994",
	month="Jun",
	day="01",
	volume="4",
	number="2",
	pages="65--85",
	abstract="This tutorial covers the canonical genetic algorithm as well as more experimental forms of genetic algorithms, including parallel island models and parallel cellular genetic algorithms. The tutorial also illustrates genetic search by hyperplane sampling. The theoretical foundations of genetic algorithms are reviewed, include the schema theorem as well as recently developed exact models of the canonical genetic algorithm.",
